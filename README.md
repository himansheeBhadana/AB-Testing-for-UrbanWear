# AB-Testing-for-UrbanWear
This project is to perform AB testing for a new button for Urbanwear's website.

Business Problem: Urban Wear is a clothing brand that's launching an eCommerce store. Currently, the pre-launch page is collecting emails from site visitors. The plan is to collect as many emails for the website launch.

The goal is to design, run and analyze an AB experiment that tests two versions of the email sign-up on the pre-launch page.

The control is the blue submit button, which is the current version. The treatment is the green submit buton.

We have to run the AB test to decide which version to use based on the AB test results.

The pretest and test are the two excel data files. AB_Testing_Code is the google collab python file that contains the code for this AB test.
